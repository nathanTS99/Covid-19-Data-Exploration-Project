# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Vaccination Progress

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes COVID-19 data, focusing on various aspects such as total cases, total deaths, infection rates, and vaccination progress. The analysis is performed using SQL queries on a dataset named Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations, which includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different locations and continents.

## Project Structure

### 1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths
- Evaluates the likelihood of death if one contracts COVID-19 in a specific country.

### 2. Total Cases vs Population
- Examines the relationship between total cases and the population of a specific country.

### 3. Highest Infection Rates Compared to Population
- Identifies countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.

### 4. Highest Death Count Per Population
- Lists countries with the highest death count per population.

### 5. Continents with the Highest Death Count Per Population
- Highlights continents with the highest death count per population.

### 6. Global COVID-19 Percentage
- Provides global statistics on total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage.

### 7. Joining COVID Deaths and Vaccinations
- Combines COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data based on location and date.

### 8. Total Population vs Vaccinations
- Analyzes the relationship between total population and new vaccinations.

### 9. Vaccination Percentage by Country
- Calculates the percentage of the population vaccinated over time for each country.

### 10. Creating a New View: Vaccination Percentage
- Defines a view named "VaccinationPercentage" to simplify the analysis of vaccination progress.
